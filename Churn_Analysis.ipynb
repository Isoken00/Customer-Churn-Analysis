        "\n",
        " A challenge for B2C businesses, it occurs when a customer stops using all of the products and services offered to them and stops being a customer. Typically, this is a bad thing for the firm because it lowers revenue.\n",

        "One of the most well-liked business applications of big data is churn prediction. It entails identifying clients who are inclined to revoke their service subscriptions.\n",

        "### Customer Churn\n",
        "\n",
        " When a customer stops using all of the products and services offered by a business, they are said to have churned. Typically, this is a bad thing for the firm because it lowers revenue. Importantly, this is performed on a cohort basis, meaning that any new clients acquired during the period are not taken into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Predicting Customer Churn Is Important\n",
        "Customer churn prediction enables businesses to reach out to clients who are at risk of leaving early and try to mend fences. In essence, it is a warning that allows you to take action. It is widely acknowledged that keeping an existing customer is much less expensive than finding new ones. Therefore, it is preferable to foresee a customer's impending churn and take steps to prevent it than to lose them and have to find a replacement.\n",

        "## Problem statement\n",
        "\n",
        "Bank XYZ has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters. As such, this has caused a huge dent in the quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce by X %. A team of business, product, engineering and data science folks have been put together to arrest this slide.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Objective__ : Can we build a model to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the customers who are going to churn in the near future? Being able to accurately estimate when they are going to churn will be an added bonus\n",
